            When it comes to recommender systems, I always remember the title song of 80’s sitcom, "Cheers". Here is
            how:
        </p>
        <p>"You wanna go where people know, people are all the same" - Content-based</p>
        <p>"You wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same" - Colloborative-filtering</p>
        <p>"Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Wouldn’t you like to get away?" …​.Where, with
            whom? - Context-Aware.</p>
        <p>Here I like to present a restaurant recommendation based on contextual information using Neo4j.</p>

    <h1 class="header">What is Context?</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a
            person,
            place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including
            the
            user and applications themselves (AK Dey & GD Abowd - ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computer Systems
            (CHI
            2000), Vol.5/Iss.1, pp.4-7, 2001).
        </p>

        <p>
            Most common types of context are Identity ('who'), Acivity ('what'), Time ('when'), and location ('where')
            and
            one can use this information to determine 'why' the situation is occuring.
        </p>

        <p>
            Traditional recommender systems use two entities (two dimensional) users and items. This recommendation can
            be
            made more personalized by using a multidimensional approach to include contextual information.

    <h1 class="header">Apply to Restaurant Recommendation</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Imported restaurant and consumer data (that relates to Mexico) from
            <a
                href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data</a>.
        </p>
        <p>User data has location, habits (like smoking, drinking), marital status, cuisine, budget, and many other
            pieces of information. For users, we can take each context (like smoking, cuisine, budget) as one dimension.
        </p>

        <img
            src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21182456/26038102/5973f520-38b5-11e7-9c6d-85b91fa95fc6.png">

        <p>Data on restaurants includes location, cuisine, smoking, alocohol, price and other information. For
            restaurants too we will have multiple dimensions to offer a better choice of restaurants based on user
            preferences.</p>

        <p>A pictorial description of a three dimensional approach is shown below:</p>

        <img
            src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21182456/26029637/fedfa15c-37ee-11e7-918c-cb7ae1b62915.png">

        <p>The three dimensions in the user cube are user, smoking, cuisine and for the restaurant cube they are
            restaurant, smoking, cuisine. The colored slice of the user cube represents the users who like same
            cuisine
            with varying presferences for smoking. These choices will then be used to select restaurants that match
            the
            selected user choices. The colored slice of the restaurant cube presents the restaurants that match the
            user
            selected choices.</p>

        <p>Same approach is applicable to even higher dimensions.</p>

        <p>
            A more personnalized recommendation of restaurants is presented based on user preferences. One problem here
            is
            the availability of relevant datasets. The more information the dataset provides, the more helpful it would
            be
            for the analysis and results.
